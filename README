A small implementation of bit packed square (0, 1) matrices, showcasing the speed difference in calculating squares.

This implementation is a naive vector<vector<int>>, yet speed gains are palpable.

For instance:

./main 4096

This will calculate the square of a random (Erdos-Renyi) 4096x4096 binary matrix, using the usual algorithm, and using bit packed matrices and bitwise operations.
It will then output how long each operation took.

Future improvements include Strassen multiplication, and, since this is embarassingly parallel, either GPU or multithreaded processing.
